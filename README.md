### Key Themes for the New Church Year
The church year begins with Advent, emphasizing waiting, hope, and preparation. Core ideas include:
- A vision of renewal, drawing from themes of light in darkness and peace amid turmoil.
- Balance between introspection and communal celebration.
- Focus on grace, rest, and recreation, inspired by biblical invitations to unburdened faith (e.g., light yokes and easy paths).

The year can be viewed as a cycle of growth, with loose divisions:
- **Year One: Open Gate** – Invitation and forgiveness.
- **Year Two: Hidden Bloom** – Inner growth and rest.
- **Year Three: Returning Light** – Outward sharing and hope.

### Advent Bible Readings
These texts are common for the start of the church year, emphasizing a humble king bringing peace and liberation.

  The earth is the Lord's, and all that is in it. Who may ascend the hill of the Lord? The one with clean hands and pure heart. Lift up your heads, O gates, that the King of glory may come in.

- **Old Testament: Zechariah 9:9-10**  
  Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! Your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey. He will cut off chariots and war bows, proclaiming peace to the nations, his dominion from sea to sea.

- **Epistle: Revelation 5:1-5**  
  No one was worthy to open the scroll, but weep no more; the Lion of Judah has conquered, able to open the scroll and its seals.
